Worksheet 14 – Faults

1. Random fault injection tool: Inject a fault and disable HMI faults page – learner must use IO screen to diagnose.

Here is the interactive simulation plan for CP6773 – Troubleshooting & Fault-Finding Closed Loop Systems.

This curriculum focuses on applying diagnostics in realistic fault scenarios. Each scenario should simulate industrial maintenance conditions where alarms are disabled, encouraging learners to use the IO screen, HMI mimic, and logical deduction.
