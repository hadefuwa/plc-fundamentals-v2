 
Name: PLC Fundamentals Trainer
Product Range:  Industrial Maintenance 
Product Code: IM6930
Curriculum Code: CP2388
Power Supply: 24V 
Product Description 
The PLC Fundamentals Trainer is a hands-on training platform designed specifically for those new to industrial maintenance and automation. It provides a structured, practical introduction to PLC-controlled systems using real-world components and industrial wiring standards. At the heart of the system is a Siemens S7-1214 PLC and a 7-inch Unified Basic HMI, delivering a realistic interface for observing how inputs and outputs interact in a typical automated process.
Rather than focusing on programming or diagnostics, the module helps learners build core knowledge from the ground up. It starts with how a basic control panel is laid out and how devices like push buttons, proximity sensors, and temperature inputs are wired into a PLC. The system includes clearly labelled terminals and a mix of digital and analogue devices, offering opportunities to explore normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC) contacts, signal types, and typical industrial safety features such as dual-channel emergency stops and output isolation through relays.
Each component has been carefully selected to reflect what learners will encounter in real facilities. From the MCB and safety relay to the red-and-white RPM feedback motors and DIN rail relays, every interaction is visible and tactile. This makes concepts like I/O mapping, contact state logic, and basic sequencing intuitive and easy to grasp.
Designed to support T-Level qualifications and foundational maintenance training, the module includes a short set of worksheets that guide users through each component’s role, wiring, and interaction with the PLC. By the end of the course, learners will have a solid understanding of how signals flow through a control system and how industrial hardware works together, even if they have never touched a control panel before.
Perfect for the hands-on learner who has never opened a control panel and isn’t sure if a PLC is a fuse or a fancy relay. This is the place to start building real industrial confidence.
Target Audience
This curriculum is designed for 16 to 18-year-old engineering students in further education colleges, as well as apprentices beginning their careers in industrial maintenance and automation. It is ideal for those studying T Levels, BTECs, or similar vocational qualifications where practical understanding of control systems is essential. The program focuses on giving learners their first exposure to PLC hardware, inputs and outputs, safety systems, and real industrial components, without requiring prior knowledge of programming or electrical systems. Whether the goal is to work in manufacturing, utilities, or process industries, this course lays the groundwork for understanding what is inside a control panel, how components interact, and how modern automation systems are built and maintained.

Electrical Safety Information
The PLC Fundamentals Trainer is designed with safety in mind and complies with relevant low-voltage and EMC standards. Users must adhere to the following safety guidance to ensure safe and correct operation.
Key Safety Notes
* Low Voltage Operation:
The system operates at 24V DC only. It does not require or tolerate direct connection to mains voltage. Doing so will result in damage and void the warranty.
* Power Supply:
Use only the supplied 24V power adapter with approved plug heads (UK, EU, US). The power supply is a Class II, CE-marked unit with overvoltage and short-circuit protection.
* Enclosure and Wiring:
All electrical components are mounted in a protective enclosure or DIN rail panel with finger-safe terminals. No exposed live connections are present under normal use.
* Fuse and Circuit Protection:
The system is internally protected by a Siemens 5SY MCB (3A, Curve B) to prevent overload or short-circuit damage.
Maintenance and Inspection
* Only qualified personnel should service or inspect internal wiring.
* Regularly inspect external cables for damage or wear.
* Do not modify wiring without referring to the system schematic and isolating power first.
* Always isolate power before performing any hardware fault insertion or removal of connectors.
Emergency and Fault Handling
* Simulated Emergency Stop:
The system includes a dual-channel E-Stop for educational and simulation purposes only. It is not connected to a certified safety relay or safety-rated PLC. Pressing the button will halt outputs via PLC logic, but should not be relied on for personal protection in real emergency scenarios.
* Reset Logic:
After the E-Stop is pressed, it must be manually reset (twist to release), followed by pressing the reset button on the front panel or HMI.
* Recommended Emergency Action:
In a real emergency, the most effective method to isolate the system is to switch off the rear-mounted circuit breaker or unplug the 24V DC barrel connector. This fully cuts power to all components.
* Fault LED Indicator:
A red system LED indicates a fault or simulated safety event. The system should not be operated until the issue is resolved.
Standards Compliance
This system is designed for educational and training use and incorporates industrial-grade components and wiring practices. While it follows best practices in system layout and electrical safety, it is not intended for use in operational industrial environments.
The system aligns with the following standards where applicable:
* EN 60204-1 – Electrical equipment of machines (informative compliance in wiring and protection practices)
* EN 61010-1 – Safety requirements for electrical equipment for measurement, control, and laboratory use
* Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU – Applicable to included power supply and components
* RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU – Restriction of hazardous substances compliance for electronic components
Note: This product does not fall under the scope of the Machinery Directive (2006/42/EC), as it is a non-functional teaching aid and does not include certified safety control circuits.
