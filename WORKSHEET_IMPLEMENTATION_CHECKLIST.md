1. Locate the "So What" section in the HTML
2. Identify existing content structure
3. Plan card-based reorganization
4. Preserve all original text content

### Step 3: HTML Restructuring
1. Group related content into `explanation-card` elements
2. Create `key-points-card` for learning objectives
3. Add appropriate FontAwesome icons
4. Maintain semantic structure

### Step 4: Content Organization
1. **Explanation Cards**: For detailed explanations and concepts
2. **Key Points Card**: For bullet-point style learning objectives
3. **Icons**: Use relevant FontAwesome icons for each section

### Step 5: Testing

2. Test responsive design on different screen sizes
3. Ensure all content is preserved and readable
4. Check for any broken links or missing elements
